What is Abstraction:
    Abstract is providing only the necessary details and hiding
    all implementations details.
Why should we learn Abstraction:
    1) it reduces the code complexity by separating the idea from implementation.
    2) It helps use enforce rules and convey our requirements.
How can we use Abstraction:
    1) create classes with abstract keyword.
    2) use the abstract keyword with method header and don't
    provide the body of that method inside the parent class.
    3) Create the child classes and extend those classes from the parent class and implement the abstract methods
    4) if we don't want to provide the implementation one or more methods
    we can declare the child class as abstract as well.
