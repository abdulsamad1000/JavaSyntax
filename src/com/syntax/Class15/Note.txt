Note For Methods
Question: What is a method:
Method in java is block of code or group of java statment
it defined the behavori of a class
we call Method---> Behavior-->function
Question: mwhy we should we use methods:
1) it help us remove the duplicate code from our application. we jsut create a method and every time we need that logic
we just call the mehtod that contains the logic.
2) it also allows to write the code in the form of modules which makes the development of large applications easier.

Question: how to use Methods:
1) firs we create the method inside a class.
2) we create the object of that class.
3) we call the method by writing the name of the object then dot and name of the method.

Question: where do we create Methods
we create methods inside the class in java the methods existe inside the class
note in other languages like python Cshop the method can stay outside the class

Example:
i want to create the class of Calculator {
void add(int x,int y){
System.out.println(x+y);            // note: if i want to call  this method what do i need. i need my main method
}
public static void main (String []args){
Calculator calculator=new Calculator();      // note: to create this calculator you need the name of this class
calculator.add(10,20);  // inside the pranteces we write the numbers like 10,20
}

}
Rules
void add(int x,int y){
System.out.println(x+y);
}
void is a return type
// the rule is every method should have a return type if it is int,double,float,boolean or void
// Note if you want to return somthing use return if you do not want to return anything use void keyword
()===> if we put anything inside this parenthesis we call it parameters
parameters mean anything inside the parenthesis
in method we can put data in the prenthesis or we can leave it blank it is optional
the two curly brakets {} we call these the body of the methods that contains the java statements

{
System.out.pritnln(x+y);
}
this is we call the body of the method which contains the java statements

add(int x,int y) this part without the void key word including parameter we call it signature of a method
this is the interview question like what is the signature of the method you should answer it after the method including
parameters we call this part the signature of the method.

void add(int x,int y) this part we call it the header of the method

((( Types of variable in java)))))
there are 3 types of variable in java (1.local,2.instance and 3.static)

1>===  local variable
if a variable is inside a method or a part of its parameter or a loop or switch statement or if else condition it called a local variable

2>===  Instance variable
if a variable is inside a class but outside any block of code like method loop or switch statement if else condition it is
called an instance variable.

3>=== Static variable
if a variable has Static key word with it then it is called a Static Variable



((( why shoudl we learn about different types of variables mean the benifites of it))))

1>>====== it help as reduce the amount of RAM that our application will be using when it will be running.
2>>====== with the help of these variables we can pass information between methods of class.
3>>====== Local variable occupy the memory for the shortest period of time. as soon as your method is done execution
they are destroyed by a special program it is call garabage collector

HOW TO USE THESE
pros vs cons   same as this Advantage vs disadvantage
1>>>>>==== The advantage and disadvantage of Local variable
>>>> Advantage of local variable
they occupy the memory for the shortest period of time always try to use local variables when possible
to save memory
>>>> Disadvantage of local variable
they are very limited in scope mean we can not access them outside of method or that block of code.


2.>>>==== the advantage and disadvantage of Instance variable
>>>> Advantage of Instance variable
they have broader scope as compared to local variables mean we can access them in all the methods o f that class.
>>>> Disadvantage of Instance variable
they occupy the space in your RAM for longer period of time.
Exp: Google chrom has a lots of instance

questions: if i want to share the information between two method of the class what variable should i use.
Answer: instance variable
question: if i want to create efficient application that do not occupy the memory what vraible should i use.
Answer: local variable
NOTE: WE SHOULD ALWAYS PREFER LOCAL VARIABLES

3.>>>> the advantage and disadvantage of Static variable
>>>> Advantage of Static variable
we can call static variable without creating an object of a class.
we can share a single variable between all the  object of a class.
