What is List in java
    1) it allows us to store duplicates
    2) insertion order is maintained
    ArrayList and LinkedList are the two most popular implementation of this interface.

When to Use ArrayList:
    when 90% of the Operations are related to retrieval then we should use ArrayList.

When to Use LinkList:
    when 90% of the Operation are manipulation mean adding and deleting -- Operation from
    anywhere inside the List then we should use LinkedList.

What is Set:
    Set is dose not allow duplicate values.
    Most Popula classes that have implemented Set interface.
    1) HashSet 2) LinkedHashSet  3) TreeSet
What is HashSet:
    Upside of HashSet: Insertion and retrieval is fastest of all sets.
    Downside: Insertion order is not maintained.
What is LinkedHashSet:
    Upside Of LinkedHashSet: it maintained the insertion order.
    Downside: slower than HashSet but faster than TreeSet.
    Retrieval speed is slowest of all.
What is TreeSet:
    Upside of TreeSet: Store the data in sorted from
    Downside: insertion speed is slowest of all

What is Map Interface in Java:
    Map allows as to store key value paris.
    most popular classes which are implemented the Map interface are     1)HashMap   2)LinkedHashMap   3) TreeMap
What is the Upside of HashMap:
    Upside of HashMap: fastest when it comes to insertion and retrieval
    Downside of HashMap: No insertion order is maintained.

What is Linked HashMap:
    Upside of LinkedHashMap: insertion order is maintained.
    Downside of LinkedHashMap: slower than HashMap but faster than TreeMap.
    Retrieval speed is slowest of all
