what is insertion order in java:
it means the first element i am going to insert in list it will store in 0

What is a List:
    List is an interface inside the collections' framework Which have below properties
    1) Insertion order is maintained.
    2) I can Store duplicate data.
List is implemented by many classes but we will be focusing on ArrayList and LinkedList:
ArrayList:
    when my requirement is that i will be reading the data a lot then i should be going
    with ArrayList.
LinkedList:
    Most of our operations will be writing the data to a list in between or in the start or shifting the
    data we should be going with LinkedList.
Iterator:
    is an interface that has three methods hasNext() next() and remove().
    whenever we try to modify the size of a list using simple loop there are chances that it will
    not work or will throw an error because lists are dynamic and can change the size at runtime
    so to be always on the safe side we should use Iterators.
========================================================================================
Set:
1) Duplicates are not allowed
We will be discussing three types of sets:
    1) HashSet 2) LinkedHashset  3) TreeSet
HashSet:
    Upside:it is the fastest of all
    Downside:No Insertion order mean it will be store inorder index  is maintained

LinkedHashSet:
    Upside:Insertion order is maintained
    DownSide: retrieval of element will be super slow
    insertion speed slower than Hashset;
    question why the retrieval speed is the sloweest
   like if want to get the number one it has to go throw all the elements and data then it will give as 100

TreeSet:
    UpSide: Elements will always be in sorted in the form of stored
    Downside: insertion speed is slowest of all
    Retrieval Speed better than linkedList but slower than Hasset.
===================================================================
Map:
Map is an interface in java that allow us store key value pairs
we can't have duplicate keys but we can have duplicate values
We will be discussing three of them
1) HashMap
2) LinkedHashmap
3) TreeMap
HashMap:
    Upside:Fastest when it comes to insert and retrieve the elements.
    Downside: No insertion order.

LinkedHashMap:
    Upside: Insertion order will be maintained.
    Downside:   Retrieval will be slowest
TreeMap:
    Upside: data will be stored in the sorted form based on key.
    Downside: insertion is the slowest.
